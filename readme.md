## Your assignment is to generate the lyrics of the song 'I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly'.

While you could copy/paste the lyrics, or read them from a file, this problem is much more interesting if you approach it algorithmically, by writing functions.
You'll want to look at what repeats in the text and what doesn't. Think about which parts repeat and which parts do not.
Can you assign values to variables and loop through lists of values to generate these lyrics?
